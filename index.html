      <h3 class="lighter-text">Our class began right as a pandemic did...</h3>
      <p class="padding">Quitting your job to go to a bootcamp in the name of changing your career
      is already a giant change. Now imagine you've quit your job and are in the midst of
    scrolling through backpacks online when you are told you cannot leave your house anymore.
    What about class? What about all the new friends you were supposed to make? How are you supposed to learn
    from home?</p>
    <br>
    <p class="padding">You decide to stick with it, even though you really didn't want to learn remotely.
    It's awkward at first. You stare at your small squares of classmates and don't say anything to eachother
    because, well, you can't. And it's terrible. You already feel awful about the state of the world,
    and now this thing you've been looking forward to is destroyed as well.</p>
    <p><b>But you decide to keep going anyways. What else would you be doing, binge watching "Tiger King" again?</b></p>
    <h3 class="lighter-text">So we tried...</h3>
    <p class="padding">Slowly, we started talking to eachother and getting to know one another. We realized that 94% of us had no fucking
    clue what we were doing... and it was comforting. So we struggled together and looked to eachother for help,
  (for our class, and our mental health). We did tons of weird shit, had hours of strange zoom calls, and eventually we started to make
sense of things.</p>
<h4 class="lighter-text">And now, I guess we're kind of okay designers (except for you Jeanine, you're suspiciously good).</h4>

<h3>I'm going to miss you guys, and thank you for making the best of a hard time.</h3>
